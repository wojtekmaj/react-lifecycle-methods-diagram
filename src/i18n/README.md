# Translation module

## Usage of translation module

1. Define translatable string in the code:
    ```js
    <T>Original phrase</T>
    ```
2. If you're the translator, add an entry in language JSON files, for example:
    ```json
    {
      "Original phrase": "Przet≈Çumaczona fraza"
    }
    ```
    You don't need to add anything for a new en-US string.

## How to add new language

1. Add a new JSON file named with by languages's [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag), e.g. `pt-BR.json`.
2. Take one of the previously set up JSONs to copy all the keys of the strings that need translations and fill in your JSON with translated phrases.
3. In `i18n.js`, add JSON file to the list of imports in `languageFiles`, e.g. `'pt-BR': import('./pt-BR.json'),`.
4. Verify that strings are loaded correctly by running the project locally.

## How it works

`getMatchingLocale` function returns a locale that is a preferred one for current user based on browser settings. Matching JSON language file is dynamically imported. Once it's loaded, original phrase is replaced by T component with translated one, provided that it was defined in proper JSON file.
